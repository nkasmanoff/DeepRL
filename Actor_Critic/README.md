# Actor Critic


Pytorch implementation of Actor-Critic Algorithms. 

As usual, credit where it's due, which is to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53y49DBxz8U&t, and a Pytorch implementation of Actor-Critic.

In the Policy Gradient folder I had two notebooks, one for the direct implementation (copy-paste), and then one with some changes + experiments. The same goes here.
