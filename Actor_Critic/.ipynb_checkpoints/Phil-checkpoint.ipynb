    "Actor critic methods are a way of reducing the amount of variance from a policy gradient. The idea is that by using two networks, or at least two different function approximators, one can learn two more easily digestible curriculums which can help an agent successfully master whatever environment it is currently in.

    "Unfortunately, there are many caveats associated with $G$ simply being the total reward to go. For one, this value is  insensitive to a relative reward difference, meaning that if you were to simply add $40$ to all possible rewards the agent receives, you could end up with a very different policy! Good policies should not be sensitive to scalar shifts. Clearly, we have some work to do... \n",
